# VRMinecraftPythonMaze
A maze generator for minecraft server using python

This is python code used to generate a minecraft maze (or rather 4 mazes) for a VR Minecraft setup of various sizes.  Each of the 4 mazes has it's own elemental gimmick but is meant to be a simple and fun experience for people who are new to virtual reality.  I would recommend playing this in creative mode for those people to prevent drowning, falling in lava, etc...

You can use the provided world as a blank copy to generate the maze in.  You will need to be standing below the overworld surface on the ground to generate the maze.

The goal of the maze is to hit each of the 4 clearly marked levers to unlock the waterfall at the beginning of the maze so you can swim to the surface.
